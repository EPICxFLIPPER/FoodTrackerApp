# Food Tracker

## Proposal

This is an application that will allow users to
easily know what items they need to shop for based
on meals they plan to eat. This is intended for
students who find checking for ingredients to be a 
hassle. This is interesting to me as I hate planning
to cook something only to realize I am missing an
ingredient. I want to remove this problem from my life.
The intended functionality of this project is for users
to be able to select a recipe from a list of recipies they
like to cook. The program will then check if the user has 
the necessary ingredients to make the meal, and
let them know what items they are missing, so that they can
effectively go shopping.

## Required Data
Users will need to enter:
- The items they initially have in their pantry
- Any recipes they might want to make.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add new recipes, which consist of a list of ingredients to my cookbook.
- As a user, I want to be able to add ingredients to my pantry that I was not told to shop for.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all the ingredient I need to shop for if I want to make a particular recipe.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove Items from my pantry that I have used.
- As a user, I want to be able to see if I can make a particular recipe with the ingreidents in my pantry.
- As a user, I want to have the option to save recipes and items that I have in my pantry for later use.
- As a user, I want to be able to load a save file of recipes and items in the pantry to continue use.
