# Food Tracker

## Proposal

This is an application that will allow users to
easily know what items they need to shop for based
on meals they plan to eat. This is intended for
students who find checking for ingredients to be a 
hassle. This is interesting to me as I hate planning
to cook something only to realize I am missing an
ingredient. I want to remove this problem from my life.

### Required Data
Users will need to enter:
- The items they initially have in their pantry
- Any recipes they might want to make.

### Proposed Functionality
Users will be able to check if they can make a meal say cheese and crackers
for example. The program will see if they have all the
required ingredients to make this recipe. The program noticed that the user did 
not have any cheese and adds it to the shopping list. After the user has 
shopped for cheese, it will be added to their pantry, and upon selcting 
make cheese and crackers, the cheese and cracker ingredients
will be removed from the pantry. The next time the user wants to make this item
they will be alerted that they are missing both ingredients.
